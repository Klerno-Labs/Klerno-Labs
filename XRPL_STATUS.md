   - Provided example API usage

## Next Steps

1. **Main Application Integration**

   - Test access control for protected routes

4. **Additional Features**
   - Implement subscription renewal notifications
   - Add transaction history for users
   - Create admin dashboard for subscription reporting

## Usage Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   XRPL_NET=testnet
   DESTINATION_WALLET=your_xrpl_wallet_address
   SUB_PRICE_XRP=10.0
   SUB_DURATION_DAYS=30
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

4. Access the API documentation at:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
   ```

## Current Status

The foundation for XRPL payments and subscription management is in place. The application is running locally, but requires integration of the new modules into the main application code. The next step is to update `app/main.py` using the examples provided in `main_integration.py` and update the templates.
