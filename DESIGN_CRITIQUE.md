# Klerno Labs – Architecture & Design Critique

Date: 2025-09-25
Scope: Current `main` application state as represented in branch `chore/dev-dx` (FastAPI monolith centered around `app/main.py`).
Goal: Surface pragmatic, high-leverage improvements that raise reliability, security, performance, and developer effectiveness with minimal risk. Prioritized into Quick Wins (<1 hour), Short Term (1 day), Medium (2–5 days), Longer-Term (multi-week / strategic).

---
## 1. Executive Summary
The codebase successfully bootstraps a feature-rich FastAPI app but concentrates too much conditional / compatibility logic inside `app/main.py`. Significant silent error suppression (`contextlib.suppress` / broad `except Exception`) obscures failures and increases production risk. Configuration and environment concerns are scattered. Observability (metrics / tracing / structured logs) is minimal. CI has been consolidated, but legacy workflows linger. Security posture is reasonable for dev but needs hardening for production (cookies, secrets hygiene, rate limiting, dependency risk scanning).

A staged path forward: (1) tighten error visibility + auth/session hardening; (2) modularize routers & compatibility layers; (3) introduce structured logging + metrics + health/readiness split; (4) refactor persistence abstraction to enable PostgreSQL; (5) add proactive security + performance guardrails.

---
## 2. Key Findings

| Category | Issue / Observation | Impact | Suggested Direction |
|----------|---------------------|--------|---------------------|
| Architecture | Monolithic `app/main.py` (~700 lines) mixes routing, compatibility shims, bootstrap, and fallbacks | Increases cognitive load & bug surface | Extract routers/features into dedicated modules; isolate legacy shims behind flag/module |
| Error Handling | Heavy use of broad `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` & `except Exception: pass` | Masks real defects & hides regressions | Narrow except blocks; log suppressed exceptions at debug level |
| Security | Session cookie flags not explicitly enforced; dev bootstrap endpoint accessible (guarded only by env) | Potential insecure defaults in production | Centralize security middleware; enforce `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`; disable dev bootstrap behind explicit `ENABLE_DEV_BOOTSTRAP` env |
| Configuration | Settings scattering (`os.getenv` inside endpoints) vs centralized `settings` | Inconsistent behavior & test brittleness | Move all env reads to `settings` layer; provide schema & validation |
| Observability | No structured logging, metrics, tracing; `/health` mixes uptime & timestamp only | Harder triage, no SLO tracking | Add logging config, request logging, Prometheus counters/histograms, OpenTelemetry (opt-in) |
| CI/CD | Legacy workflows kept alongside new consolidation | Noise & potential duplication triggers | After verifying stability, archive/delete deprecated workflows |
| Testing | Smoke vs full test split is good, but no coverage gating or property-based tests | Blind spots in edge logic | Add coverage threshold & targeted property tests for parsing / auth states |
| Performance | No caching layer; heavy dynamic imports each request (some redundant) | Latency overhead & cold-start cost | Preload critical routers; lazy-load only expensive modules via dependency injection |
| Persistence | Direct DB calls and raw fallback queries scattered | Harder to migrate DB backend | Introduce repository layer + explicit session context |
| Security (Rate / Abuse) | No rate limiting or brute-force login protection | Credential stuffing risk | Add simple in-memory or Redis-based rate limiter wrapper |
| Secrets | Dev fallback secrets auto-generated / hardcoded (e.g., default admin creds) | Risk of accidental reuse beyond dev | Force explicit `.env` for non-dev; warn/fail if defaults remain in prod |
| Compatibility Layer | Multiple duplicate compatibility endpoints (`/auth/login` defined more than once with forwarders) | Hard to reason about final route resolution order | Consolidate into a single compatibility adapter module |
| Silent Fallbacks | Duplicate fallback endpoints (e.g., iso20022 parse declared twice) | Potential confusion & maintenance hazard | Retain only explicit primary endpoint + one guarded fallback in dedicated module |
| Logging | `print()` used for lifecycle events | Hard to aggregate/process logs | Replace with structured logger + JSON option |

## 3. Prioritized Improvement Backlog

### 3.1 Quick Wins (< 1 hour each)

1. Add structured logging initializer (JSON toggle via `LOG_FORMAT=json`).
2. Replace `print()` with logger calls (`logger.info`, `logger.warning`).
3. Introduce a helper `suppress_debug(exc, context)` that logs suppressed exceptions at debug when `APP_ENV != production`.
4. Remove duplicate ISO20022 endpoint definitions (retain primary + documented fallback or unify).
5. Add explicit cookie security flags in session middleware configuration (document dev differences).
6. Add `/ready` endpoint (readiness) distinct from existing `/health` (liveness/uptime) — readiness checks DB connectivity.
7. Add `X-Request-ID` propagation into logs (already in header, just log it).
8. Fail fast if running in `production` while using default dev admin credentials.
9. Add Safety (dependency vulnerability) scan step to consolidated CI workflow (optional job).
10. Annotate legacy compatibility blocks with `# TODO(remove-compat-Q1-2026)` style tags to drive eventual cleanup.


### 3.2 Short Term (1 day)

1. Extract large compatibility + legacy endpoints into `app/compat.py` with a registration function (e.g., `register_legacy_endpoints(app)`).
2. Create `app/routers/` package and move domain clusters: auth, admin, analytics/compliance, iso20022, transactions, premium.
3. Centralize configuration: a single `settings.py` using `pydantic.BaseSettings` + validation (fail if critical missing in non-dev envs).
4. Introduce `observability.py` for metrics: HTTP request counter, latency histogram, startup time gauge (Prometheus client already available in dev requirements).
5. Introduce a test fixture for ephemeral SQLite DB per test module (reduce cross-test coupling and flakiness).
6. Add coverage report to CI (pytest `--cov=app --cov-report=xml`) + badge (after initial baseline capture).


### 3.3 Medium (2–5 days)

1. Abstract persistence: Create `repositories/` layer with interfaces (users, transactions, analytics) — initial implementation sits atop current store (SQLite); design to swap PostgreSQL with minimal API changes.
2. Implement rate limiting middleware (e.g., token bucket in-memory, pluggable backend later) for auth + premium endpoints.
3. Add background tasks / async task queue interface (placeholder) for high-latency operations (compliance scanning, large analytics). Start with synchronous stub to keep footprint small.
4. Introduce OpenTelemetry tracing integration (exporter optional; no-op if not configured) for cross-request correlation.
5. Introduce domain service layer (e.g., `services/auth_service.py`, `services/analytics_service.py`) to decouple API from business logic.
6. Implement security headers module generating CSP with nonce + optional strict transport security toggle.
7. Consolidate duplicate `/auth/login` forwarders into a single adapter that normalizes input then calls core login logic.
8. Introduce incremental database migration mechanism (Alembic) — even if SQLite now, keeps path open.


### 3.4 Longer-Term (Strategic / Multi-Week)

1. Multi-database abstraction (SQLite dev, PostgreSQL / Cockroach prod) with connection pooling & health instrumentation.
2. Full audit logging (security events: login success/fail, privilege escalations, subscription changes) piped to structured sink.
3. Feature flags system (simple DB or env-driven) to phase out compatibility endpoints gradually.
4. Pluggable AI / analytics micro-services (extract heavy analytics to separate service with async queue + gRPC/HTTP interface) once performance demands.
5. Comprehensive threat modeling & security review (JWT rotation, key management, secret scanning pre-commit, SAST/DAST pipeline additions).
6. Real-time event stream (WebSocket / SSE) for dashboard updates; tie into monitoring metrics.
7. Performance benchmarking harness (Locust or k6) integrated into optional CI stage.
8. Data retention & archival policy (cold vs hot store separation, PII minimization strategy).

## 4. Architecture Refactor Outline

| Phase | Focus | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| A | Decompose monolith file | Smaller router modules; main becomes orchestration shell |
| B | Observability | Logging + metrics + readiness/liveness separation |
| C | Security & Hardening | Cookie flags, rate limiting, secret validation, bootstrap gating |
| D | Persistence Abstraction | Repository interfaces + migration scaffolding |
| E | Scalability & Async Ops | Background tasks + tracing + initial service extraction patterns |

Each phase yields independent PRs (<500 LOC diff) to keep review friction low.

---

## 5. Security Hardening Checklist (Actionable)

- [ ] Enforce `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` (except when `APP_ENV=development`).
- [ ] Set `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Strict` on session cookies.
- [ ] Add global exception handler capturing unhandled errors → structured log with request ID.
- [ ] Verify strong bcrypt cost factor (`rounds`/`bcrypt.gensalt()` strength) and document tradeoffs.
- [ ] Secret validation: refuse startup if `JWT_SECRET` equals known default in non-dev.
- [ ] Rate limit `/auth/login` (e.g., 5/min/IP baseline) with clear 429 response JSON.
- [ ] Deprecate `dev/bootstrap` endpoint or require `ENABLE_DEV_BOOTSTRAP=1` + non-production env.
- [ ] Implement dependency vulnerability scan (Safety or pip-audit) in CI (non-blocking at first, then gating).
- [ ] Add Bandit (if not already active) gated selectively for high severity.

## 6. Observability Plan

| Layer | Tool | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Logging | `logging` + JSON + request ID | Inject middleware to attach `request.state.request_id` |
| Metrics | `prometheus_client` | `/metrics` endpoint (guard or behind auth in production) |
| Tracing | OpenTelemetry SDK | No-op unless `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` set |
| Profiling (later) | py-spy / sampling profiler | Run in staging under load tests |

Add sample metric names:
- `http_requests_total{method,route,status}`
- `http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{route}`
- `startup_timestamp_seconds`
- `db_query_latency_seconds` (future when repository adds instrumentation)

---

## 7. Testing & Quality

| Gap | Remedy |
|-----|--------|
| Coverage unknown | Add coverage run + badge; set gradual minimum (start 40%, ratchet +5%) |
| Silent suppress hides test failures | Inject test-mode flag that asserts no suppressed exception occurred (collect into list) |
| Integration vs unit mixing | Introduce `tests/integration/` and `tests/unit/` directories for clearer scope |
| Performance regressions undetected | Add micro benchmark harness (pytest-benchmark) for critical endpoints |
| Auth edge cases (expired / tampered tokens) | Add property-based tests with Hypothesis for token decode logic |

---

## 8. Data & Persistence

Current state: direct DB access patterns inside routes / compatibility code with fallback raw queries.

Improvements:
1. Define repository interfaces (`UserRepository`, `TransactionRepository`).
2. Provide SQLite implementation now; stub PostgreSQL variant with TODO markers.
3. Introduce unit tests mocking repositories (decouple logic from storage).
4. Prepare migration framework (Alembic): even if no migrations yet, baseline revision prevents drift.
5. Encapsulate transaction boundaries (context manager) to prevent leaks.

---

## 9. Configuration & Environment Management

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Mixed `os.getenv` usage in runtime code | Centralize in `settings.py` (Pydantic `BaseSettings`) |
| Unsafe defaults leaking | Make dev defaults explicit; raise in production if unchanged |
| Implicit environment values | Provide `.env.example` (already added) + doc precise required vars |
| Feature staging | Add `FEATURE_COMPAT_ROUTES=1` to toggle legacy endpoints |

Add validation example (future):
```python
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    app_env: Literal['development','test','staging','production'] = 'development'
    jwt_secret: str
    database_url: AnyUrl | str = 'sqlite:///./data/app.db'
    class Config:
        env_file = '.env'

    @validator('jwt_secret')
    def strong_secret(cls, v, values):
        if values.get('app_env') != 'development' and v in ('changeme','secret','dev'):  # nosec
            raise ValueError('Insecure JWT secret for non-dev environment')
        return v
```

---

## 10. CI / Dev Experience

Completed: Smoke test workflow + consolidated core CI.
Next Steps:
1. Remove legacy workflow files after 2–3 green runs with new pipeline.
2. Add optional matrix (OS: ubuntu, windows) for portability of path-sensitive scripts.
3. Cache `.mypy_cache` / ruff caches for faster iteration (optional, evaluate ROI).
4. Add `pre-commit` config enforcing formatting + lint locally.
5. Introduce dependency vulnerability scan job (non-blocking initial).
6. Add artifact upload of coverage XML for future quality gates.

## 11. Risk Register (Top 5 Near-Term)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Hidden exceptions due to suppress blocks | High | Medium | Replace with logged/narrow suppress; test-mode assert none suppressed |
| Weak or default secrets in higher env | Medium | High | Startup validation & deployment checklist |
| Route ambiguity / duplication | Medium | Medium | Consolidate compatibility modules |
| Lack of metrics slows incident response | Medium | Medium | Implement metrics + readiness early |
| Expanded feature work without repo abstraction | Medium | High | Introduce repository layer before scaling feature code |

---

## 12. PR Breakdown (Initial Wave)

| PR | Title | Scope (Lines Approx) |
|----|-------|----------------------|
| 1 | chore(logging): structured logger & replace prints | <150 |
| 2 | feat(health): add /ready & readiness checks | <120 |
| 3 | refactor(routes): extract legacy compat to compat.py | 200–300 |
| 4 | chore(config): centralized pydantic settings | 150 |
| 5 | feat(observability): add metrics middleware + /metrics | 180 |
| 6 | chore(security): session cookie flags + secret validation | <120 |
| 7 | refactor(repos): introduce repository interfaces | 250–400 |
| 8 | feat(ratelimit): basic in-memory rate limiter | <160 |
| 9 | ci(security): add safety scan job | <80 |
| 10 | chore(cleanup): remove legacy workflows | <30 |

---

## 13. Acceptance Criteria Samples

| Feature | Criteria |
|---------|----------|
| `/ready` Endpoint | Returns 200 only if DB openable; 503 otherwise; JSON includes `status`, `db`, `uptime_seconds` |
| Logging Refactor | All startup messages use logger; no raw `print()` in main modules |
| Secret Validation | App exits with clear error if insecure secret & `APP_ENV=production` |
| Metrics | `GET /metrics` exposes `http_requests_total` and `http_request_duration_seconds` |
| Rate Limiting | Exceeding threshold returns 429 JSON: `{"error":"rate_limited","retry_after":<seconds>}` |

---

## 14. De-Scoping / Non-Goals (For Now)

- Full microservice decomposition (premature until performance pressure justifies).
- Complex feature flag service (env variable toggles suffice initially).
- Real-time streaming (WebSockets) before baseline observability & security hardening.
- Automated canary / progressive delivery (needs deployment infrastructure clarity first).

---

## 15. Summary & Next Recommended Actions

Immediate (today): implement structured logging + readiness endpoint + suppress wrapper; open small PRs.
Next (this week): extract compatibility code, centralize settings, add metrics & secret validation.
Following: repository abstraction + rate limiting + CI vulnerability gating.
Strategic: tracing, PostgreSQL migration path, feature flag retirement cycle, background task offloading.

This staged approach minimizes risk, improves introspection, and builds a runway for higher-scale architectural changes without halting ongoing feature work.
