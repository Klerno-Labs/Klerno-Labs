Notes & Next Steps

I could not create the PR automatically from this environment because the `gh` CLI is not installed and package managers are unavailable here. To open the PR locally or in the browser:

- Browser: https://github.com/auricrypt-ux/custowell-copilot/compare/main...cleanup/tests-ci
- Local `gh` (if installed):
  `gh pr create --base main --head cleanup/tests-ci --title "ci: defer heavy imports, centralize DB runtime connection, add CI + lint fixes" --body-file PR_BODY.md`
