Title: chore/dev-dx â€” Developer DX, readiness checks, smoke tests, lint/type fixes

Summary:
This branch modernizes developer experience and hardens import-time behavior so CI fails fast on initialization problems. It adds readiness checks, local developer tools (DB seed, login probe, smoke runner), small static-analysis fixes, and documentation.

Tests:
- mypy: no blocking errors
- pytest: 153 passed, 1 skipped

Checklist:
- Review readiness script and unit test for false positives/over-strict checks.
- Confirm dev seeder/login probe are safe to run locally.
- Verify smoke test wiring and webhook signing logic meets security expectations (CI secrets required).

Follow-ups:
- Run stricter mypy pass with --check-untyped-defs and triage findings (separate PR).
- Consider refactoring dynamic shims and builtins injection to a single compatibility module.
