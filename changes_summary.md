# Changes Summary (so far)

This file records the minimal, targeted modifications performed during Phase A audit and early Phase B bootstrap.

Files added/created
- `deletion_audit.md` — audit of Deletion/ with recommended actions.
- `Trash me/` — quarantine folder for problematic or informative legacy files.
- `clean_app_review.md` — initial quality assessment notes.
- `final_tree.md` — snapshot of CLEAN_APP folder structure.

Files modified (non-destructive)
- `CLEAN_APP/app/main.py` — added compatibility aliases for `/auth/register` and `/auth/login` and improved import logic to include auth router via importlib. Also added middleware for security headers and X-Request-ID.
- `CLEAN_APP/app/security/__init__.py` — added `preview_api_key` and `rotate_api_key` shims to satisfy imports.
- `deletion_audit.md` created with per-file recommendations.

Rationale
- Preserve one canonical implementation per concern (CLEAN_APP). Add only minimal shims to keep tests and legacy imports working.

Next steps
- Complete Phase A by reconciling any remaining inbound references to Deletion/ and moving any unique code into CLEAN_APP.
- Continue Phase B: run and fix the auth integration tests until green, then broaden to other test batches.
