# Klerno Labs CI/CD Analysis & Refactor

## Issues Identified in Existing Workflows

### From .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
1. **Duplicated triggers**: Both workflows trigger on push/PR
2. **Continue on error**: All linting/testing steps continue on error, masking failures
3. **Matrix inefficiency**: Python 3.10/3.11 matrix with no real need for both
4. **Missing dev dependencies**: Installing pytest/black/flake8 inline instead of requirements-dev.txt
5. **Obsolete actions**: Using actions/setup-python@v4 and actions/cache@v3
6. **Wrong cache paths**: Using ~/.cache/pip instead of platform-specific paths
7. **Docker build without context**: Docker build fails due to missing dependencies

### From .github/workflows/ci.yml
1. **Incomplete ruff checks**: Only checking specific files, not entire codebase
2. **Missing mypy configuration**: Running mypy without proper config
3. **No caching**: No pip cache configuration
4. **Missing spell check**: No spell checking configured
5. **Hardcoded file lists**: Ruff checks hardcoded specific files only
6. **Missing scripts**: References scripts/ci_smoke.py which may not exist

### Common Issues
1. **No concurrency control**: Multiple runs can conflict
2. **No path filtering**: Both frontend/backend run unnecessarily
3. **No artifact collection**: Coverage reports not collected
4. **No spell checking**: Spell check not configured
5. **Inconsistent Python versions**: Mixed 3.10/3.11 requirements
6. **Missing aggregation job**: No single status check for branch protection

## Proposed Solution

Single canonical CI pipeline that:
- Uses Python 3.11 consistently
- Implements proper caching
- Adds comprehensive spell checking
- Uses modern actions versions
- Includes concurrency control
- Provides single aggregation status
