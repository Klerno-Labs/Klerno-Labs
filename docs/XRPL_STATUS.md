4. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling for edge cases
5. **Performance**: Optimize database queries for subscription checks
6. **Analytics**: Add tracking for conversion rates and subscription metrics

## Environment Setup Requirements

To enable XRPL integration, the following environment variables should be set:

```
# XRPL Configuration
XRPL_NETWORK=testnet  # or mainnet for production
XRPL_WALLET_ADDRESS=rPT1Sjq2YGrBMTttX4GZHjKu9dyfzbpAYe  # Your wallet address
SUB_PRICE_XRP=10  # Base price for Basic tier
```

## Known Issues

- Wallet monitoring for incoming transactions not yet implemented
- No webhook support for payment notifications
- Error handling for network issues needs improvement
- No automatic renewal process for subscriptions

## Compatibility Notes

- Requires xrpl-py v2.0.0 or higher
- Compatible with both SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production)
- Works with Python 3.9+ (tested on 3.11)
