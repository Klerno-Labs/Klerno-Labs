# CHANGES IN `chore/dev-dx`

This file summarizes the non-functional and developer-experience changes made on the `chore/dev-dx` branch.

## Summary
- Restored and hardened dev DB seed and login probe tools (`tools/seed_local_db.py`, `tools/login_probe.py`).
- Added a readiness script to surface import-time CI failures: `scripts/check_prod_readiness.py`.
- Implemented smoke-test tooling and local orchestration (`tools/run_local_smoke.py`, `tools/prod_smoke_test.py`).
- Hardened enterprise entrypoints to avoid import-time failures in minimal environments (guarded imports, runtime shims).
- Applied extensive linting and type-safety improvements: ruff autofixes, small mypy-directed adjustments and targeted `# type: ignore` where runtime dynamics require it.
- Fixed a mypy false-positive around `SessionMiddleware` in `enterprise_main_v2.py` by using a runtime-typed variable and guarded import.
- Added unit test(s) for `scripts/check_prod_readiness.py` and kept full test-suite green: `153 passed, 1 skipped`.

## Developer Notes
- Tests and smoke tooling rely on a local SQLite DB by default. Use `tools/seed_local_db.py` to seed the dev user.
- CI smoke workflows (in `.github/workflows`) were adjusted to sign webhook payloads using HMAC-SHA256. CI secrets required: `SMOKE_ALERT_WEBHOOK`, `SMOKE_ALERT_SECRET`, `SMOKE_ALERT_MENTION` (optional), `SMOKE_ALERT_ISSUE_LABELS`, `SMOKE_ALERT_ISSUE_ASSIGNEES`.
- Typing debt: many modules still have untyped function bodies (informational mypy notes). These will be addressed in follow-up PR(s) that standardize settings factory and reduce runtime shims.

## Remaining work (recommended follow-ups)
- Comprehensive typing pass (mypy) focusing on `app/` modules: convert key dynamic shims into well-typed factories or explicit runtime-cast boundaries.
- Tidy up remaining ruff warnings in tests (some use `pytest.raises(Exception)` intentionally; consider narrowing exception types where possible).
- Convert legacy `tools/` scripts to a small `scripts/` CLI with subcommands for easier developer UX.

## How I validated
- Ran `python -m ruff check . --fix` iteratively and applied safe edits.
- Ran `python -m mypy .` to confirm no blocking errors remain.
- Ran full test suite: `python -m pytest -q` => `153 passed, 1 skipped`.

If you'd like, I'll prepare the PR branch, squash commits, and open a draft PR with this changelog and an itemized reviewer checklist.
