# ADDITIONS_MINIMAL

This file will document any intentionally added files that were necessary because no suitable canonical implementation existed in `CLEAN_APP/` or `Trash me/`.

So far, no new functional files were created beyond small compatibility shims and documentation artifacts. If new helper files are required during Phase B (e.g., `app/compat.py`), they will be listed here with justification and a short explanation.

Current additions:
- `deletion_audit.md` — audit artifact (documentation only)
- `Trash me/` directory created for quarantine
- `clean_app_review.md`, `changes_summary.md`, `final_tree.md`, `runbook.md` — documentation artifacts to guide the cleanup
